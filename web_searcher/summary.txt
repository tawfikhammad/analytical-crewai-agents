**Current Population Growth and Trends**
Egypt's population is rapidly expanding, projected to reach 116-118 million by mid-2025 from 50 million in 1985, fueled by a 1.69% growth rate and a Total Fertility Rate of 2.8 births per woman.

**Government Strategies for Population Management**
In response, the government has implemented the "Two is Enough" campaign and a National Population and Development Strategy, focusing on reproductive rights, human capital, and women's empowerment to align growth with national development goals.

**Socio-Economic and Environmental Impacts**
This rapid growth significantly strains finite resources such as water and food, exacerbates urban sprawl, contributes to environmental degradation, and pressures job creation, healthcare, and education services.
